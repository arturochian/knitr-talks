This is a talk that I gave at [UseR! 2014](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu). I did not prepare any slides, and just used an R script with two images plus two sound effects. You are recommended to use RStudio to run this R script.

Below are a few pictures taken by the audience (credits to [@matlabulous](https://twitter.com/matlabulous) and [@R_projekt](https://twitter.com/R_projekt)).
